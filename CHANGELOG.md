## 2.4.1

* **Modified readable attributes in cheftacular.yml** Added _slack_ key with nested keys _webhook_ and _default channel_

* Logs bag will now store the exit status on deploys. Successful deploys will only store a "Successful Deploy" but failed deploys will store the last 100 lines of logs

* Saving to logs bag will now correctly be disabled when executing on nodes

* Created new "failed-deploy" log directory to store the output of failed deploys

* Fixed issue with running cft clean_cookbooks

* Improved slack command to allow it to accept arguments from other methods as well as being a standalone command

* Failed deploys will now send slack notifications if _slack:webhook_ is set.
